    <p>At TaxEasePro, we strive to provide high-quality, accurate, and timely tax compliance services. We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. This Refund & Cancellation Policy explains when and how refunds are processed for our Services (ITR filing, GST registration/returns, tax notice replies, etc.).</p>
    <p>Please read this policy carefully. By booking or paying for any Service, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. General Refund Rule</h2>
    <p>No Automatic Refunds After Service Commences: Once you have opted for a Service, made payment, and our team has started processing (e.g., reviewing your uploaded documents, preparing returns, or initiating filing), the fee is non-refundable.</p>
    <p>This is because our team (Chartered Accountants, advocates, and accountants) invests time, expertise, and resources immediately upon booking to deliver the Service efficiently (often within 24 hours).</p>

    <h2>2. Exceptions – When Refunds May Be Issued</h2>
    <p>We understand mistakes can happen. If you believe your case qualifies for a refund, contact us immediately. We review requests on a case-by-case basis and issue refunds only when we determine the issue is genuine.</p>
    <p>Possible scenarios where we may approve a full or partial refund:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wrong Service Selected by Mistake: If you accidentally booked the wrong Service (e.g., ITR-3 instead of ITR-1) and inform us before we start processing (i.e., before any document review or preparation begins).</li>
        <li>Technical Error on Our Side: If a clear error occurs due to our website or system (e.g., double charging).</li>
        <li>Service Not Delivered Due to Our Fault: If we are unable to deliver the promised Service for reasons entirely under our control (rare).</li>
        <li>Other Genuine Cases: Any situation you believe is fair and reasonable (e.g., immediate cancellation due to personal emergency).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Refunds are not guaranteed and are at our sole discretion. We aim to be fair and customer-friendly.</p>

    <h2>3. How to Request a Refund or Cancellation</h2>
    <p>Contact us as soon as possible via:<br>
    Email: taxeasepro@zohomail.in<br>
    WhatsApp: [Your WhatsApp Number Here]</p>
    <p>Provide your order/booking ID, name, and a clear explanation of the issue. We will review your request within 2-3 business days and respond. If approved, the refund will be processed immediately to your original payment method.</p>

    <h2>4. Refund Processing Time</h2>
    <p>Approved refunds are processed within 3-7 business days. The amount will reflect in your bank account or wallet within 5-10 business days, depending on your bank or payment provider.</p>

    <h2>5. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
    <p>No refund will be issued in these cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After our team has started processing your documents or filing.</li>
        <li>Change of mind after processing has begun.</li>
        <li>Delays or issues caused by government portals (e.g., Income Tax Department, GSTN downtime).</li>
        <li>Errors or penalties due to incomplete, inaccurate, or late documents provided by you.</li>
        <li>Any attempt to misuse the refund policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>If you file a chargeback with your bank or payment provider without first contacting us, we reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Suspend or terminate your account.</li>
        <li>Provide evidence (booking details, communication, processing logs) to dispute the chargeback.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage direct communication – most issues are resolved quickly and fairly.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with an updated date.</p>
