      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 12, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By participating in the TaxEasePro.in Partner Program, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. Acceptance is confirmed by ticking the consent box during signup, which is timestamped and logged with your IP address and user agent. If you do not agree, do not join or use the program. These terms form a binding agreement between you and TaxEasePro.in.</p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>To join the Partner Program, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be at least 18 years old.</li>
        <li>Be a resident of India.</li>
        <li>Possess valid credentials, such as a PAN, and for professionals like CA or CS, an active ICAI/ICSI membership.</li>
        <li>Not be barred from similar programs due to fraud or legal issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Eligible participants include Loan Agents, Insurance Agents, Property Dealers, CSC Owners, Freelancers, Bank Sales Executives, Investment Advisers, CA, and CS. We reserve the right to reject applications.</p>

      <h2>3. Registration Process & Verification</h2>
      <p>To register, sign up on our dedicated portal providing required details including PAN, GSTIN, and professional memberships. Undergo verification via government APIs and professional portals. Upon approval, you receive a unique Partner Code. False information leads to immediate termination.</p>

      <h2>4. Partner Code & Referral Rules</h2>
      <p>The Unique Partner Code issued is non-transferable. Share your code with clients for attribution. No spamming, misleading claims, or unauthorized use of branding is allowed. Violations may result in code revocation.</p>

      <h2>5. Commission Structure</h2>
      <p>Partners earn lifetime recurring commissions on every GST/ITR payment from referred clients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General Partners:</strong> 10% of the payment value.</li>
        <li><strong>CA and CS Partners:</strong> 20% (higher due to outsourcing expertise).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Commissions are calculated based on the net fee paid by the client and are subject to TDS under sections 194J/194-I.</p>

      <h2>6. Client Discount</h2>
      <p>Clients using your Partner Code receive a 5% instant discount on their filings. This does not affect your commission calculation, which is based on the pre-discount fee.</p>

      <h2>7. Attribution & Eligibility Rules</h2>
      <p>We follow a First-touch attribution model. Referrals are valid within 90 days of code entry. Self-referrals and fake clients are strictly prohibited and monitored via IP patterns.</p>

      <h2>8. Payout Terms</h2>
      <p>Payouts are made monthly on the 15th via direct bank transfer, subject to a minimum threshold of ₹1000. TDS will be deducted as per the Income Tax Act.</p>

      <h2>9. Fraud Prevention</h2>
      <p>Bans on self-referral and manipulation are strictly enforced. We use device info and IP patterns for detection. Fraud may be reported to authorities under the IT Act.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination Rights</h2>
      <p>You may terminate via the dashboard. We reserve the right to terminate for inactivity (6 months), violations, or fraud without notice.</p>

      <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>You are granted a limited license to use TaxEasePro.in logo for referrals. All IP remains ours; unauthorized commercial use leads to liability.</p>

      <h2>12. Limitation of Liability & Indemnity</h2>
      <p>Our liability is capped at commissions paid in the last 12 months. You indemnify us against claims resulting from your misrepresentations or violations.</p>

      <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>Disputes are resolved via arbitration in Kanpur under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Courts in Kanpur have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

      <h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>Neither party is liable for delays due to events beyond control, except for payment obligations.</p>

      <h2>15. Amendments to Terms</h2>
      <p>We may amend terms with 30 days' email notice. Continued participation implies acceptance of changes.</p>

      <h2>16. Entire Agreement & Severability</h2>
      <p>These terms constitute the entire agreement. If any provision is found invalid, others remain enforceable.</p>

      <h2>17. Governing Law</h2>
