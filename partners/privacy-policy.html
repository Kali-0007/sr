        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>
            <p>We process your data solely for legitimate purposes related to the Partner Program. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verification and Onboarding:</strong> To confirm your identity, eligibility, and professional credentials (e.g., PAN validation, CA/CS membership check) to prevent fraud and ensure only qualified partners join.</li>
                <li><strong>Commission Calculation and Payout:</strong> To track referrals, calculate 10% lifetime recurring commissions for general partners or 20% for CA/CS on GST/ITR payments from referred clients, and process monthly payouts via bank transfer (minimum ₹1000 threshold).</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Prevention and Security:</strong> To detect and prevent activities like self-referrals, fake clients, or unauthorized use of Partner Codes by analyzing IP addresses, referral patterns, and other data.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Compliance:</strong> For deducting and reporting Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) under sections 194J or 194-I of the Income Tax Act, and complying with GST laws, including filing returns and audits.</li>
                <li><strong>Program Management:</strong> To provide you with a unique Partner Code, track client discounts (5% instant discount applied via your code), and manage attributions (e.g., first-touch model with a 90-day window).</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements:</strong> To fulfill obligations under DPDP, IT Act, RBI guidelines, and other laws, such as retaining records for audits.</li>
            </ul>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Legal Basis</h2>
            <p>Our data processing is grounded in multiple legal bases to ensure compliance and transparency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We rely on your explicit, granular consent for most activities, obtained through separate checkboxes during signup (detailed in Section 6).</li>
                <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> Processing is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations under the Partner Program, such as calculating and paying commissions or providing Partner Codes.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> For fraud detection, security enhancements, and program improvements, where your interests are not overridden (e.g., analyzing referral data to prevent abuse).</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> To comply with laws like the Income Tax Act for TDS, GST for tax filings, DPDP for data protection, IT Act for electronic records, and RBI for payment processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We balance these bases carefully, conducting assessments where required under DPDP.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Granular Consents Required</h2>
            <p>Consent is a cornerstone of our data practices. During signup and at key interactions, you must provide explicit, informed consent via 5-6 separate checkboxes. Each consent is granular, clear, and optional where possible (e.g., marketing is opt-in only). Consents are timestamped, logged with your IP address, user agent, and the consent version number for auditability.</p>
            <p>The specific consents include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Consent for Data Collection: "I consent to TaxEasePro.in collecting my personal data, including name, email, phone, PAN, GSTIN (if applicable), bank details, and for CA/CS, membership number and registration year, for the purpose of onboarding and verification."</li>

                <li>Consent for Sharing with Third Parties: "I consent to sharing my data with payment gateways, banks, and verification portals (e.g., ICAI/ICSI) for payouts, verifications, and compliance."</li>
                <li>Consent for Fraud Detection and Security: "I consent to the use of my data, including IP and device info, for fraud prevention, security monitoring, and program integrity."</li>
                <li>Consent for Tax Compliance: "I consent to data processing for TDS deductions, GST compliance, and legal reporting as required under Indian laws."</li>
                <li>Opt-In for Marketing (Separate): "I opt-in to receive marketing communications about program updates, new features, or promotions via email or phone (you can withdraw this at any time)."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can withdraw non-essential consents anytime, but this may affect program participation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We share your data only when necessary and with trusted parties, ensuring they adhere to similar privacy standards:</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Data Storage & Security</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored securely in India-based servers to ensure compliance and protection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage Practices:</strong> Data is retained for 7 years as required for tax records under the Income Tax Act and GST laws, or longer if legally mandated. Non-essential data is deleted upon request or program termination.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We use industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for transit), access controls (role-based access, multi-factor authentication), regular security audits, and firewalls. All data is pseudonymized where possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention Periods:</strong> Verification data: 7 years; referral data: until program end + 7 years; marketing data: until withdrawal.</li>
