    <h2>2. Scope – What Data is Collected</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers the personal data we collect from you as a partner in the Partner Program. We collect various types of data to enable program participation, verify identities, process commissions, and ensure security and compliance. The data we collect includes, but is not limited to: Personal Identification Information: Full name, email address, phone number, date of birth (for age verification). Financial and Tax-Related Information: Permanent Account Number (PAN), Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN) if applicable, bank account details (including account number, IFSC code, and bank name for commission payouts). Professional Credentials: For CA and CS partners, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) or Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) membership number and year of registration. Technical and Device Information: IP address, device type, browser user agent, operating system, and other device identifiers. Referral and Program Data: Unique Partner Code, details of referred clients (such as referral timestamps, client usage of your code), commission earnings data, and payout history. Other Data: Any additional information you voluntarily provide during signup, dashboard interactions, or communications with us, such as proof of identity documents if required for verification. We do not collect sensitive personal data beyond what is necessary for the program, and we ensure all collection is purposeful and minimal.</p>

    <h2>3. How Data is Collected</h2>
    <p>We collect your data through secure and transparent methods to ensure accuracy and consent. The primary channels include: Signup Form: When you register for the Partner Program on our dedicated portal, you provide details like name, email, phone, PAN, GSTIN (if applicable), bank details, and for CA/CS, membership number and registration year. Dashboard Interactions: Once registered, you may update or provide additional data via your partner dashboard, such as referral tracking or payout preferences. Payment Gateway Integrations: During commission payouts or client referrals, data like bank details is collected or verified through integrated payment gateways. Automated Collection: Technical data like IP address, user agent, and device info is automatically collected when you access our website or portal using server logs and similar technologies. Third-Party Verifications: For fraud prevention, we may collect verification confirmations from external sources, such as ICAI/ICSI portals for CA/CS credentials or government databases for PAN/GSTIN validation. All collection points are designed with security in mind, using HTTPS encryption and secure forms.</p>

    <h2>4. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>
    <p>We process your data solely for legitimate purposes related to the Partner Program. These include: Verification and Onboarding: To confirm your identity, eligibility, and professional credentials (e.g., PAN validation, CA/CS membership check) to prevent fraud and ensure only qualified partners join. Commission Calculation and Payout: To track referrals, calculate 10% lifetime recurring commissions for general partners or 20% for CA/CS on GST/ITR payments from referred clients, and process monthly payouts via bank transfer (minimum ₹1000 threshold). Fraud Prevention and Security: To detect and prevent activities like self-referrals, fake clients, or unauthorized use of Partner Codes by analyzing IP addresses, referral patterns, and other data. Tax Compliance: For deducting and reporting Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) under sections 194J or 194-I of the Income Tax Act, and complying with GST laws, including filing returns and audits. Program Management: To provide you with a unique Partner Code, track client discounts (5% instant discount applied via your code), and manage attributions (e.g., first-touch model with a 90-day window). Legal and Regulatory Requirements: To fulfill obligations under DPDP, IT Act, RBI guidelines, and other laws, such as retaining records for audits. Data is not used for any unrelated purposes, and we regularly review our processing activities to ensure they align with these goals.</p>

    <h2>5. Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>Our data processing is grounded in multiple legal bases to ensure compliance and transparency: Consent: We rely on your explicit, granular consent for most activities, obtained through separate checkboxes during signup (detailed in Section 6). Contract Performance: Processing is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations under the Partner Program, such as calculating and paying commissions or providing Partner Codes. Legitimate Interest: For fraud detection, security enhancements, and program improvements, where your interests are not overridden (e.g., analyzing referral data to prevent abuse). Legal Obligation: To comply with laws like the Income Tax Act for TDS, GST for tax filings, DPDP for data protection, IT Act for electronic records, and RBI for payment processing. We balance these bases carefully, conducting assessments where required under DPDP.</p>

    <h2>6. Granular Consents Required</h2>
    <p>Consent is a cornerstone of our data practices. During signup and at key interactions, you must provide explicit, informed consent via 5-6 separate checkboxes. Each consent is granular, clear, and optional where possible (e.g., marketing is opt-in only). Consents are timestamped, logged with your IP address, user agent, and the consent version number for auditability. The specific consents include: Consent for Data Collection: "I consent to TaxEasePro.in collecting my personal data, including name, email, phone, PAN, GSTIN (if applicable), bank details, and for CA/CS, membership number and registration year, for the purpose of onboarding and verification." Consent for Processing for Commissions: "I consent to the processing of my data for calculating and paying commissions (10% or 20% lifetime recurring on referred clients' GST/ITR payments) and tracking referrals." Consent for Sharing with Third Parties: "I consent to sharing my data with payment gateways, banks, and verification portals (e.g., ICAI/ICSI) for payouts, verifications, and compliance." Consent for Fraud Detection and Security: "I consent to the use of my data, including IP and device info, for fraud prevention, security monitoring, and program integrity." Consent for Tax Compliance: "I consent to data processing for TDS deductions, GST compliance, and legal reporting as required under Indian laws." Opt-In for Marketing (Separate): "I opt-in to receive marketing communications about program updates, new features, or promotions via email or phone (you can withdraw this at any time)." You can withdraw non-essential consents anytime, but this may affect program participation.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We share your data only when necessary and with trusted parties, ensuring they adhere to similar privacy standards: Payment Gateways and Banks: For processing commission payouts and verifying bank details. Verification Portals: Such as ICAI/ICSI for CA/CS membership validation, or government APIs for PAN/GSTIN checks. Tax Authorities: If required for TDS reporting, audits, or legal inquiries under the Income Tax Act or GST laws. Service Providers: Limited to encrypted, need-to-know basis for IT support or fraud detection tools. No data is shared for marketing without opt-in consent. All sharing complies with DPDP and includes data processing agreements.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely in India-based servers to ensure compliance and protection. Storage Practices: Data is retained for 7 years as required for tax records under the Income Tax Act and GST laws, or longer if legally mandated. Non-essential data is deleted upon request or program termination. Security Measures: We use industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for transit), access controls (role-based access, multi-factor authentication), regular security audits, and firewalls. All data is pseudonymized where possible. Retention Periods: Verification data: 7 years; referral data: until program end + 7 years; marketing data: until withdrawal. We conduct regular vulnerability assessments and comply with RBI guidelines for financial data.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Subject Rights</h2>
    <p>Under DPDP and other laws, you have robust rights over your data: Access: Request a copy of your data. Rectification: Correct inaccurate or incomplete data. Erasure: Delete data when no longer needed (except legal retention, e.g., tax records). Restriction: Limit processing in certain cases, like disputes. Portability: Receive data in a structured format for transfer. Withdraw Consent: Revoke consents (may lead to program suspension if essential). To exercise rights, email privacy@taxeasepro.in. We respond within 30 days, free of charge unless excessive.</p>

    <h2>10. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>We use essential cookies for session management, security, and basic analytics (e.g., tracking logins). No third-party tracking cookies are used for advertising. You can manage cookies via browser settings, but disabling may affect functionality. We do not track across sites without consent.</p>

    <h2>11. International Data Transfer</h2>
    <p>All data processing and storage occur within India. No international transfers are made, ensuring compliance with DPDP restrictions on cross-border data flows.</p>

    <h2>12. Data Breach Notification Procedure</h2>
    <p>In the event of a data breach, we follow DPDP requirements: Assess and contain the breach within 72 hours. Notify affected individuals and the Data Protection Board if it poses significant harm. Provide details on the breach, impacted data, and mitigation steps via email. We maintain incident response plans and log all breaches.</p>
