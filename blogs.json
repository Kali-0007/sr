    "content": "<p>Every year as tax season approaches, the biggest question on every taxpayer's mind is: <b>\"Should I stick with the Old Tax Regime or switch to the New Tax Regime?\"</b> With major changes in Union Budget 2025, the New Tax Regime has become even more attractive—it’s now the default option, offering zero tax up to ₹12 lakh income (₹12.75 lakh for salaried with standard deduction). But it’s not the best choice for everyone. Let’s break it down in simple terms so you can save the maximum tax this year.</p><h3>1. New Tax Regime: The Simple & Lower Rate Option</h3><p>The New Regime was introduced to simplify taxation. It offers lower tax rates, but you forgo most deductions like 80C, HRA, and home loan interest. It’s ideal for those who want to avoid the hassle of investment proofs and paperwork.</p><ul><li><b>Standard Deduction:</b> ₹75,000 for salaried individuals.</li><li><b>Tax-Free Income:</b> Zero tax up to ₹12 lakh; effectively ₹12.75 lakh with standard deduction.</li><li><b>New Tax Slabs (FY 2025-26):</b><ul><li>₹0 - ₹4 lakh: 0%</li><li>₹4 - ₹8 lakh: 5%</li><li>₹8 - ₹12 lakh: 10%</li><li>₹12 - ₹16 lakh: 15%</li><li>₹16 - ₹20 lakh: 20%</li><li>₹20 - ₹24 lakh: 25%</li><li>Above ₹24 lakh: 30%</li></ul></li></ul><h3>2. Old Tax Regime: Great for Investors</h3><p>The Old Regime has higher rates but allows multiple deductions such as Section 80C, 80D, HRA, and home loan interest. It’s beneficial for those with home loans or heavy insurance investments.</p><h3>3. Which is Better?</h3><p>If total deductions (80C + 80D + HRA) are less than ₹6-8 lakh, the New Regime saves more. For high incomes with substantial deductions, the Old Regime can still be more advantageous.</p><div style='background: #111; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #00d4ff; border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 30px;'><p style='color: #00d4ff; font-weight: bold;'>Confused with calculations?</p><p>TaxEasePro experts are here to help you choose the right regime for FREE!
