  "title": "New vs Old Tax Regime: How to Choose the Best One in 2025-26?",
  "content": "<p>Every year as tax season approaches, the biggest question on every taxpayer's mind is: <b>\"Should I stick with the Old Tax Regime or switch to the New Tax Regime?\"</b> With major changes in Union Budget 2025, the New Tax Regime has become even more attractive—it’s now the default option, offering zero tax up to ₹12 lakh income (₹12.75 lakh for salaried with standard deduction). But it’s not the best choice for everyone. Let’s break it down in simple terms so you can save the maximum tax this year.</p>\n\n<h3>1. New Tax Regime: The Simple & Lower Rate Option</h3>\n\n<p>The New Regime was introduced to simplify taxation. It offers lower tax rates, but you forgo most deductions (like 80C, HRA, home loan interest). It’s ideal for those who want to avoid the hassle of investment proofs and paperwork.</p>\n\n<p><b>Key Features for FY 2025-26:</b></p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Standard Deduction:</b> ₹75,000 for salaried individuals.</li>\n    <li><b>Tax-Free Income:</b> Zero tax up to ₹12 lakh (due to ₹60,000 rebate under Section 87A); for salaried, effectively ₹12.75 lakh with standard deduction.</li>\n    <li><b>New Tax Slabs (FY 2025-26):</b>\n        <ul>\n            <li>₹0 - ₹4 lakh: 0%</li>\n            <li>₹4 - ₹8 lakh: 5%</li>\n            <li>₹8 - ₹12 lakh: 10%</li>\n            <li>₹12 - ₹16 lakh: 15%</li>\n            <li>₹16 - ₹20 lakh: 20%</li>\n            <li>₹20 - ₹24 lakh: 25%</li>\n            <li>Above ₹24 lakh: 30%</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Old Tax Regime: Great for Investors & Home Loan Holders</h3>\n\n<p>The Old Regime has higher rates but allows multiple deductions and exemptions. It’s beneficial for those with home loans, insurance, children’s fees, etc.</p>\n\n<p><b>Major Deductions:</b></p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Section 80C:</b> Up to ₹1.5 lakh (PPF, ELSS, LIC, home loan principal).</li>\n    <li><b>Section 80D:</b> Health insurance premiums.</li>\n    <li><b>HRA:</b> Rent exemption (for salaried).</li>\n    <li><b>Section 24(b):</b> Up to ₹2 lakh on home loan interest.</li>\n    <li><b>Standard Deduction:</b> ₹50,000 (for salaried).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No changes in Old Regime slabs—zero tax up to ₹2.5 lakh, then 5%, 20%, 30%.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Which is Better? Understand the Break-Even Point</h3>\n\n<p>It all depends on your <b>total deductions</b>. After Budget 2025 changes, the New Regime is more beneficial for most people (especially those with low deductions).</p>\n\n<p><b>General Rule (2025-26):</b></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>If total deductions (80C + 80D + HRA + home loan interest, etc.) are <b>less than ₹6-8 lakh</b>, New Regime saves more.</li>\n    <li>For high incomes (₹24 lakh+), Old Regime is better only if deductions exceed ₹8 lakh.</li>\n    <li>Example: Young professional without home loan → New Regime gives higher take-home. Family with home loan & insurance → Check Old Regime.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Tip:</b> Always calculate tax under both regimes. Use online calculators or consult experts. New is default; you must specifically opt for Old.</p>\n\n<h3>Other Important Points</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>New Regime is default, but salaried individuals can switch every year while filing ITR.</li>\n    <li>Section 87A rebate not available on capital gains in New Regime.</li>\n    <li>Wrong choice can cost thousands in extra tax.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>In 2025-26, the New Tax Regime brings huge relief for the middle class—zero tax up to ₹12.75 lakh! But if you have substantial deductions, Old Regime can still be advantageous. Always do the math for both.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background: #111; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed #00d4ff; border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 30px;\">\n    <p style=\"color: #00d4ff; font-weight: bold;\">Confused with calculations?</p>\n    <p>No worries!
